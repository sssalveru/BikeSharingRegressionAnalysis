# Regression Analysis on Bike Sharing

## Abstract 

This project is focused on analyzing the daily count of rental bikes for casual users between the years 2011 and 2012 in the Capital bikeshare system in Washington, D.C. with its corresponding weather and seasonal information. We want to determine which attributes of the dataset can be used to build a linear regression model to predict the number of casual riders. After conducting relevant transformations and model selections, we are interested in determining which factors have the biggest effect on daily casual rider counts and the average casual rider counts for an average day in each season.
